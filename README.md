# Usage

```npm install```

Development: `npm run local`

Production: `NODE_ENV=production npm start`

# Possible Future Enhancements

1. use css extension language (e.g. sass)
1. host css/js in cdn for stability and availability
  * create bundle on build server so-as not to build during app startup 
1. front-end tests
1. more back-end tests
