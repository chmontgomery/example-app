# Possible Future Enhancements

1. notify user of errors hitting the github api
1. proxy all github requests through server so as to avoid github's public rate limit (60 rph)
1. use css extension language (e.g. sass)
1. host css/js in cdn for stability and availability
  * create bundle on build server so-as not to build during app startup 
1. front-end tests (e.g. jasmine and karma)
1. more back-end tests
1. implement async/await on server for code simplicity
1. support keyboard shortcuts for easier navigation
1. better loading indicators and splash screen
1. aria support
